# the-drive
....as in 'a car drive'.

A blender animation and teamwork exercise.

This project will focus on:
Organizing blend files for teamwork.
Learning to use github.

The result: An animation of a car / camera driving past all the models we add. Like another idea better? Just fork the project and change it to your liking. :)
I recommend maximum 20.000 quads pr model to begin with.

/blend
This directory contains a 'main.blend' file. Other files are linked into this file. If you want to see the animation in blender, use this file.

'child_' blend files are linked into the 'main.blend' file. If you want to add your own object to the animation, I suggest you fork this project, add the file in your own fork, and make a pull request.

How to get started:
Doing this requres a little knowledge of github.
If you need help, feel free to contact me. But first watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be
And look over this page: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

In short, what you do: Branch the project, add your files. Request a pull to master.
Becarefull when working on files that others are working on in their branches. This may result in conflicting files that cant be automatically merged. It is recommended to coordinate with the file owner.

Security recommendation: In preferences under save and load set 'Auto run python scripts' to diabled, before opening downloaded blender files. Alternatively do this for the folder 'downloads'.
